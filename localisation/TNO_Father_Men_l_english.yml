 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_MEN_DESC:0 "알렉산드르 블라디미로비치 멘은 많은 이들에게 목동이 되어 달라고, 그의 보살핌 속에 양떼의 생명을 맡겨 달라고, 또는 그들 어깨에 놓여진 천국의 무게를 느껴달라고 부탁한 적이 없다. 그럼에도 불구하고 그는 이 모든 것, 즉 북부의 아버지다. \n\n그러나 그가 항상 그랬던 것은 아니다. 어린 시절 세례를 받은 유대인 아이였던 멘은 여섯 살 때 그의 아버지가 NKVD에 의해 거짓 혐의로 굴라그에 끌려가는 것을 목격하며 전 세계 많은 이들이 그랬듯이 공포와 폭정에 강한 확신을 갖게 되었다. 비록 연방에서의 지하 예배는 위험했지만, 멘은 교리에는 매우 비정통 했으나 독실한 기독교인으로 남아 있을 수 있게 되었다. 성별, 인종, 심지어 신앙까지 초월하는 평등을 굳게 믿는 남자의 사상은 교회 내에서, 아니 연방 전체에서조차 거의 알려지지 않은 것이었다. \n\n연방의 붕괴 이후의 암흑기에, 멘은 얼어붙은 북쪽의 땅에서 고군분투하는 농민들을 위로하고, 그들에게 하나님의 사랑을 전하며, 주님의 사랑을 받아들이지 않는 이들에게는 자신의 말을 전하고 있는 남자 자신의 모습을 발견했다. 그는 그들에게 진정으로 자유로운 남녀의 땅, 평등주의의 땅, 모든 것이 사슬에 묶이지 않을 공동체와 마을이 있는 곳에 대한 희망을 말했다.\n\n그의 믿음과 행동은 시베리아의 고립된 지역사회에서 지지를 모으기 시작했다. 처음에는 천천히, 그리고 한꺼번에, 북쪽의 고립된 마을들은 그들의 아버지에 대한 믿음을 맹세했다. \n\n오늘날 북부는 그토록 오랫동안 성스러운 어머니 조국을 불길에 휩싸이게 한 혼란에 맞서 행진하며, 아버지의 조심스러운 시선으로 고통받는 모든 사람에게 용서와 구원을 가져다 줄 것이다."

No matter what will happen, no matter the hardships experienced, and no matter the dangers that lie ahead, we are God's tools to ensure that regardless of the events in the coming months, God will ensure that the darkness will not now, nor ever, overcome the light.\n\n"Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, 'I am the light of the world.

Indeed, it seems like it has already begun to paint a target on our backs by some of the more paranoid despots and their lackeys. Thus, we need to begin to prepare for a great confrontation with the armies of darkness. It has become obvious that we will approach this two-fold: the first is by preparing Sudoplatov and his troops, and the second is by beginning to mobilize our Christian militias and arming them in any way possible. Sudoplatov, while somewhat of a wild card, has been useful to us so far. It is time that we put our faith in him and his soldiers - they will be an integral part in our upcoming struggles. And our militias, filled with the most vehement of our followers, will flow over the forces of darkness like a second flood - but this time, instead of water punishing the wicked, it will be our brave soldiers, fighting for the sake of the light."

 OMO_sudoplatovs_brigade:0 "스도플라토프의 여단"
 OMO_sudoplatovs_brigade_desc:0 "It's no secret that Pavel Sudoplatov is an odd and eccentric character - his career has previously been defined by everything that we preach against, including his cooperation with and employment by the terror of Irkutsk, Genrikh Yagoda. That being said, it's also clear the benefit that Sudoplatov has brought with him - not only his military know-how and experience in the south, but a whole brigade of soldiers, loyal to his beck and call. On top of this, he has also achieved the fame and status of a folk hero, who has been continuously fighting against injustice after his defection, a man seeking redemption for his past acts. For now, Sudoplatov seems to be a willing ally of ours, and his brigade - a group of professional, NKVD-trained troops, are ultimately an invaluable asset for us going forwards."

 OMO_infiltrate_their_castles_desc:0 "Sudoplatov and his loyalists are all quite familiar with the asymmetrical warfare which will be invaluable to our cause in the coming years. Indeed, our message of a popular, Christian movement against the despots of the Far East will be highly popular among some of the most impoverished and poor peasants in their villages. Thus, we should arm Sudoplatov's agents with their experience and our message in order to infiltrate our enemy's frontlines and disrupt their stability via the instigation of peasant revolts. This will not only cause destabilization but surely their retaliation, which, typical of agents of darkness will only serve to win over more people to our beliefs.\n\n"To the sound of musicians at the watering places, there they repeat the triumphs of the Lord, the triumphs of his peasantry in Israel.

As such, we need to begin organizing our believers into coherent armed forces, peasant armies, so to speak, under the banner of God and the liberation of our brothers. These "fraternal militias" will be the backbone of our liberation forces, and will be trained to the best of our abilities both for asymmetrical and conventional forms of warfare, to ensure that they are best equipped for the upcoming conflict. After all, many of the volunteers who have already come forward, have never even fired a rifle at another human before.\n\n"It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.""

Bandits, moneylenders, and sinners reign supreme in these cities, and despite our best efforts to remove these agents of darkness from power, we've been unable to. At this point, in order to secure our control over the towns in our territory, we must mobilize the peasants in order to drive the darkness out of the towns and restore the light within the people there, integrating them into our communal union. Many have pointed out that this would indeed be a good initial exercise for the newly-formed Fraternal Militias, who are still ironing out some of the more glaring issues."

While this patriotic move was widely regarded as popular, since then, the Far Eastern Fleet, realizing the harsh conditions of Kamchatka have resorted to piracy and thievery to scratch out a living on the frozen peninsula. Their piracy is indiscriminate, and they target both the poor and the rich, Russian and non-Russian. Clearly, these former patriots have lost sight of the true way, and have embraced the darkness. It is time that we once again mobilize our fraternal militias and expel the pirates from the Kamchatka, by force if necessary, in order to integrate it into our ever-growing mandate and save those under their control!"

We can live by example, quote from the Holy Texts, and show the benefits of the Communal Union, but these men are too far gone to be confronted with the truth and accept it. Thus, it's clear that further action must be taken to ensure that the people under their autocratic rule are freed from their chains and allowed to see the message. Father Men has already scheduled a public sermon that is to be broadcasted to all those to hear, about the importance of tenacity and spiritual purity, rousing the masses and preparing all for the beginning of the struggle against the oppressors."

It is time to liberate our brothers and sisters in Christ from the tyranny of the Bolshevik pretenders and their reactionary, fascistic counterparts. The struggle will not be an easy one but it is a necessary one.

Jeremiah 9:6.\n\nIt is written: their words shall be obedient but their hearts will be far away. So has it been for those that claim to rule the Far East - the yoke of those peoples that once followed God has grown heavy under the rule of the godless, those who would spin fables of a golden future of freedom even as the present shook under their iron-tipped boots. But the people of the Lamb will not be shaken by their lies.\n\nAlready our brethren in the Godless Places, the Red-Banner Lands, spread the Word, desperate, ceaseless in their efforts. They whisper of broken promises and the whips whose cracks echo behind the marching armies. They hint at the sorrow that belies all trust in the world and its "protectors", its Marshals and Premiers - and at a better one in the making. One where the Prince of Peace has made a true, lasting, just home for all Russians.\n\nAnd, they say, the time is coming when that home will be ripe for the taking."

And so it goes on and on, without end until the King of Heaven returns.\n\nThe latest to take up this mantle claims continuity from the blood-spattered Union that came before it - and like that old tyranny fell apart in turn, once its sins broke their fetters and overwhelmed the men who ruled over it. Their kingdom without a king worships Yagoda, and behind him the blood-red gun-barrel, as the arbiter of truth. Power and power alone their watchword, they broke the backs of the villages they conquered, without even the pretence of serving the people they claimed to represent.\n\nNothing is new under the sun. With every Pharaoh that comes, a Moses rises from the bulrushes - and the Red Sea stirs once more.

His shall be the Kingdom of God alone - and the coronation draws ever nearer.\n\nLiturgies shall be made understandable in vernacular speech to the people, and their purpose explained to hungry souls. The Bible, so long the sole province of priests and their Old Church Slavonic, will be translated and distributed to the masses desperate for a dream. And the Wandering Priests that once spread the Gospel across Russia shall be reborn, a final generation of prophets for an age of fresh wonders.\n\nAs the Church rebuilds itself, its walls shining like the sun, the Lord Himself shall dwell among them - and victory, now as ever, belongs to those who bear the Cross."

And now that despots reign unfettered across the Rodina, the time has come to promise the lost exactly what they want to hear - freedom, not in a hundred years or a dozen, but now.\n\nThe Priests we have sent across the lands of the Far East deliver pamphlets by the thousand, speaking household by household of a freedom unlike any other - freedom from the yokes of Red and Black, freedom from the petty Tsars and their worthless courts, freedom to live and love and worship. The lights shine in the darkness - and the darkness shall not overcome them.\n\nFor, they say, a final battle approaches - and this time the seas shall not close over armies alone, but sweep away the whole of broken Russia.

We will create agencies to manage the finances and the laws in the Far East, and ensure that these positions are filled solely with those we deem virtuous. There is no room for the complainer, the doubter and the closet secularist in our New Jerusalem, and certainly not in its highest offices.\n\nAs for those who deem it corruption, or accuse us of marrying power to the Church: their courage is well-placed, even if their faith is not.

Why make enemies of those we could use to spread the Good News?\n\nAnd as we pray with them, we will keep one eye open, and one ear to the ground - the kingdom we are building here is vast as our Lord is kind, but it has no room for those who would turn traitor again."

Underneath the perversion of the Cross that is their symbol, thousands march to the beat of a single man, and thousands more tremble in fear of the horrors unmentionable that await anyone that steps out of line.\n\nSuch a creature is an abomination unto the Living God. The men of the Father are, however, masterful snake-handlers. And as we face down the latter-day Serpent in his rotting citadel, we will break the will of his handlers, so that the people of Magadan may once again be liberated from their bondage."

There is no denying that his men are effective on the battlefield and he has many connections to those who may help our cause, but Father Men sees his conduct as barbarous and unchristian. By working closely with Sudoplatov we might be able to bring the Father's word to all of Russia, but we must be careful that we do not lose sight of our values if we do.

Sudoplatov has offered to further integrate them into our forces, using the NKVD as the basis for a new army.

By reminding them of the teachings of God and the Father, we may be able to persuade them to act in a more Christian manner towards their foes.

Now that eastern Siberia has been unified, Sudoplatov has begun calling for Father Men to increase his control. The Father agrees that a formal police force to maintain public order is necessary, but Sudoplatov wishes to go several steps further. He has asked that his men be authorized to enforce discipline in the villages and communes of the Mandate. This would be a step back towards the tyranny of the NKVD, but it may be a necessary step.

God is the only one fit to judge his children, and we shall leave the matter of judgement for Him in his infinite wisdom. We shall maintain good order and Christian ethics throughout our nation, but we do not need the authoritarian methods Sudoplatov has called for to do this.

Our territory has grown rapidly and it is already massive. Controlling this much land will require a strong and purposeful hand. Sudoplatov's new security force will make sure that the laws of the nation are rigorously followed. After all, every flock needs its shepherds to guide the wayward sheep back to the pasture.

They hide themselves in shadows and strike without mercy, denying their foes a chance to surrender and repent and not caring how many innocents they hurt or kill as long as they accomplish their goal. Their methods are unchristian but there's no denying how effective they are. Sudoplatov has offered to use their talents against our enemies. Fighting in such a dishonorable way is contrary to everything the Father teaches, but if we are to unite Russia as Christ has commanded such tactics may be necessary."

We shall meet them, as friends or as enemies, honorably and righteously, knowing that we stand with the Lord and he will not fail us.

Sudoplatov's methods are dishonorable, even cowardly, but they might make the difference between a quick conflict and a drawn-out struggle. If a few unchristian acts could save thousands of Christian lives and prevent untold suffering, would it not also be unchristian not to act and condemn so many good children of the Lord to perish? Father Men is uncomfortable with the decision but he must care for his followers above all else. He can only hope that God will understand that he is just a man, as imperfect as any other.

After months of intensifying conflict between the two, Sudoplatov's demands have finally stopped coming in. It appears a new equilibrium has been reached. Either Sudoplatov has finally accepted Men's teachings and realized the error of his old ways, or the Father has succumbed to enough of his temptations that he is ready to escalate his campaign to reform Siberia to the next level. Only the Lord knows which shall come to pass. For the people of Russia, time shall have to tell."

The followers of Heaven thus marched on, rising above the chains of enslavement and oppression. However, while such men and women fought and killed for their freedom, the Father whispered softened words...\n\n"But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you.""

"I am Genrikh Yagoda, proud servant of the Central Committee of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Punishing Hand of the Revolution, and he who rejects your false words!" did the man scream. The crowd screeched forth, demanding the man's immediate death for the LORD; however, so defiantly tall did the Father stand at the man's side, bending to meet the poor man's beaten face. "Be not afraid, my elder. For we seek not your death, but, merely, God's redemption of this sunken land. Perhaps you may join us for a step forward into a new life?"\n\nYet, a Wall of Sin came to meet the Father's eyes. "Do you all forget Bukharin? Alexander Men is nothing but a fraudulent cultist!" screamed the man named Yagoda, only to be met with the cries of a fierce peasantry, ready to tear him apart. "Be not afraid." the Father proclaimed, as he laid his hand upon the official, calling a grin deep from the clouds of Heaven.\n\nO God in Heaven, how surely does a coiled serpent strike? Thus was answered on that day, as the man's coat pocket revealed the Invention of Tokarev, aimed directly at the Father's skull. By God's greater light, however, this serpent was defanged, as a sharp click echoed through the frosted winds, followed by the thunderous silence of thousands of onlookers. 'Twas only when a child nigh older than her tenth year threw a stone into the man's skull in return did a hundred more follow, as the crowd birthed a mob that birthed a lynching.\n\nSo greatly did the Father weep, however, as his fingernails felt the scrapings against the Siberian stone of the ground, and his only warmth remaining flowing down his face from his eyes, praying to the Almighty that they may find redemption and lay down their thirst of angered blood."

So then did the Father climb the great steps in the Odigitrievsky Cathedral, where he ordered the defeated meet them. So here, in the great Cathedral of Our Lady of Smolensk, would the Father find those who stood defiant against the orders of the LORD!\n\nBut punish the young sailor whose eyes met him in those upper corridors. Rather, the goldenness of respects were given, as incenses were burned and the candles lit in honor of the Almighty. This child sought not the redemption towards God in Heaven; rather, he sought a guarantee for the rights of his people, the happiness of his people, the lives of his people. Honored was his soul despite damnation, and virtuous was his mission. How could one claim justice in the death of such a noble soul, willing to do all of God's work shedding his name?\n\nIn his mighty wisdom did the Father deliver the sailor child's penance: serve his court as a servant of the good LORD, and spread the good news and devotion to God wherever the Father himself went! Surely, however, did the Vessel of God recognize an utter lack of faith despite his acceptance of the absolution; nevertheless, so great did the Father witness his carrying out of good acts across the people of Russia, as he would have wanted all along."

It was only by the Eleventh hour, however, that the sun began to shine across the city, and thus give light upon the christened forces of the North. Thus was when every armed man, mercenary and native alike, drew to the city walls, preparing for the potential outbreak of violence that could consume the city, and bring ruin to every family inside. It was Matkovsky who organized these men, as the bright sun shone down on every potential combatant that day, shining a great light upon the Father, as he drew closer to the gates of Magadan as if wandering the gates of Heaven.\n\nFurthermore, it was Matkovsky who marched downwards through the City Gates, realizing the sharp truth regarding the bloodbath which had been prophesied to follow for weeks on end now. This was it, the time was now for Magadan to siege hell against the Northern invaders who sought to undo the progress of the local leader, Matkovsky. And maybe, just maybe, could he secure for himself a means of escape if everything went according to plan.\n\nThe next few hours shed an ocean of blood deep into the Siberian snow. Americans, Germans, South Africans, and Russians themselves all found themselves fighting and dying on the Gate of Magadan that day, all of whom had carried the rifle to bear against the Shield of Christ that day. Nevertheless, they all found themselves at the mercy of the merciful Father that day, with the Matkovsky having been caught in a damaged vehicle in a dash to escape the burning city.

So greatly did the children of Omolon descend upon the city that day, fighting bravely to secure a new age of justice and prosperity under the watchful eyes of the LORD for this greatly battered land!\n\nHowever, it was in the palace of this falsified emperor's empire that the truth gave way under the light of the Almighty. A band of traitors led this land, citing the legal texts of warfare and militancy as their gospel, and proclaiming an innocent soul as being their leader, one who greatly wept at the bloodshed, calling for his return home 'cross the great seas. Consolation set forth across all Russians that day, as the soldiers of Omolon collected the band of despots ruling over this land whilst our Father so greatly convened with the man held hostage by his own heritage. Such life was not fit for this man; such prisonership was no life for any man.\n\nAnd thus, leaving behind a trail of hanged men, did this foreigner once more set sail for his home.

In this way, it is through the mighty work of our Father, the Vessel of our God, that we are able to find ourselves the heroic leaders of this great expanse, giving all in Russia a holy light to look upon for guidance and salvation in the shadow of these dark times.\n\n'Twas upon the frosted crystal of the high cathedral that our Father looked upon the fruit of his people upon the bank of the Omolon. The lost, the abandoned, the weak, transformed under the light of Heaven into the mighty soldiers of the Only begotten Son, born forth into a fractured world to bring forth the Kingdom of God to Earth once more, as foretold in the Book of Revelations.

He thought clearly upon a single image, ruminating in his head since this great journey started so long ago: that of the rainbow. Not prophetic nor apocalyptic scriptures gouging for reclamation and vindication, but the truest showcase of God our Father could muster in his mind: beautiful, awe-inspiring, and loving.

Just as the Prophets had done, the voice of God within him spilled through the small spaces of the heart. A smiling woman nursing her son in the light of a Church's medical bay. A peasant rebuilding a torn-down tenement with the aid of smiling worker-priests. A repentant sinner anointing the world with joy in the Godless Nations to the West, where the Tyrants yet reigned in their delusions.\n\nThese, and more, the Father prayed for. His heart, like an alabaster jar, spilled open to intercession - and to revival, should it prove necessary.\n\nNot long had he prayed before he was shown the treatment even Paul had not been offered in all his years of service. The Lord brought his eyes to a pool, somewhere in a deep forest, and as he looked, he cried out: for the image he beheld in its reflection was none other than the Christos Pantokrator. Emperor of the Universe! Triumph of David! His voice spoke syllables at one with the speech of angels, and as he trembled, the warm touch of the Savior embraced him: not in judgement, but in love.\n\nCome, my servant, the Lord whispered. Look again. And the image of the pool was none other than that of his own father. I love you, he whispered - and then the Father was Father no longer, but Alexander Men, the burning eyed boy who loved his parents and God with a zeal fierce enough to shake the heavens themselves. He reached out, and as he touched the face it became his own.\n\nThe Father rose in a cold sweat, his ears ringing with the touch of the Divine, and he whispered: Blessed is the lion whom the man shall devour, that the lion shall become man.

On his soil-caked arms was a woven basket full of steamed potatoes. Imploring eyes glinted past his shambled locks, and past the crowd that stood at least ten paces away from him. Intrigued, Father Men asked an elder, "Who is that man outside your palisades? And why dare he not seek refuge within?"\n\n"A trifling matter Father," replied the old man. "We here have learned not to bother with Yegor the Mad. That he'd lost his wife and children saddens us, but grief is no excuse for slovenly appearances." Then the elder guided the Father to the hall - but his hand met empty air.\n\nFor the Father was halfway through the hall and Yegor when the elders and villagers gathered their wits. One shouted, "Where are you going, Father Men?"\n\nWithout glancing back he said, "Why, to partake in the blessings of Yegor, son of God.

"It takes no small fortitude to endure Siberia's climes and emerge a war's victor against all odds." Never to mince words, Artem chided, "Are you daft, Stefan? Did not the Prophets say that the strongest are those with knowledge and wisdom? Then it should stand to reason that the Father's intellect had borne the fruits around us." Kuzma offered his own thoughts after Stefan and Artem exhausted themselves. "I find it hard to believe Father Alexander would have succeeded without gift of gab.

"Then you're wiser than three of my disciples put together!" He turned towards bristling Stefan, Artem, and Kuzma after shooing the child off. "Remember the LORD's teachings you three," the Father continued. "'I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.'

In his wisdom, however, he knew so easily that not all were so devoted to the Church and the belief in God; rather, it was the fiery image of unity which they clinged to, politics over religion, action over faith. It was knowing this that guided our Father upon what to do, as in knowing that not every man was so pious among a land of the devout called for a compromise for the betterment of all man.\n\nThus, it was shown that the most devoted and the most fervent believers of the faith of our God, the Holy Trinity who gave way for our life were assembled earlier than all others for the Mass that day. Some offered scorn and insult against the other men and women who labored early and could not, or chose not, to attend the Holy Assembly; however, with our Father's guiding words, they were hushed from all disrespect. Mass was made with haste and with purpose, allowing for the devotee to Emmanuel to find himself able to worship in spirit. All others of Omolon watched as the Father concluded his rushed Mass far earlier than the others, striking a note of confusion and fear within some of the peasantry who had assembled in worrying what the Father may have planned for those who disregarded the mass, fearing as all others had feared for disagreement in years prior.\n\nBut persecution was not the answer, nor the heavy hand of oppression and scorn. No, rather, it was the hour to assemble for the poor, the lowly, and the hungry of their land. Every servant to our Father and thus our LORD came that day, bearing gifts of bread and soup and pleasantries to be handed out to all who starved on the streets of Omolon. And sang and praised and feasted they did, as the notes of Church Hymns alongside the Russian folksong gave joy to the mind of our Father."

 OMO.35.t:0 "Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as Thyself"
 OMO.35.d:0 "It was upon the Seventh day of the LORD's week that our Father looked upon the lowly and formerly disheartened who now joined alongside his holy dominion in hopes of bringing about a new era of Christian devotion. In his wisdom, however, he knew so easily that not all were so devoted to the Church and the belief in God; rather, it was the fiery image of unity which they clinged to, politics over religion, action over faith. In his primary duty to the LORD above all, our Father knew it was right to render obedience to him and him alone; however, was it not truly right to serve the crowds of unbelievers out there, who commit to good works in this life despite a lack of faith?\n\nThis question tested our Father as he stepped down from his living quarters and descended from his cathedral on the bank of the Omolon, where night skies still hung over an early morning. All manner of devotees made their way to his doorstep for morning Mass; yet, it was not what they found. Rather, our Father recognized the need to forge a new assembly for all men, rather than just his select devoted. And thus did he muster men of all kinds to assemble a new experience to enjoy, one found not oft within the frozen lands of Siberia: that of a festival. Of course, the LORD Almighty was showcased in some of the imagery at the festival that day, but never was it made to be the end-all be-all for the assembled that day. Nay, for it was the duty of all who assembled that day to love and drink and feast and make merry, as was right for them to do, and enjoy themselves in their fractured state of this world.\n\nNevertheless, our Father abandoned not his hardworking children. For when they had come to believe that they must abandon the Sabbath that day, it was our Father who picked them up through the night, and assembled them into his cathedral. And there they celebrated the sacraments, broke bread and gave thanks, and made peace with the LORD, in the quiet of the night."

 OMO.36.t:0 "The LORD is my Strength and my Shield"
 OMO.36.d:0 "The riverbank of Omolon held not the lowly city of those abandoned by tyrants of olde days yonder; no, for this had become far more under the guiding love of God Almighty. A dominion of the devoted, a dominion of laborers, soldiers, fathers, and sons, and a dominion of Emmanuel himself. All to be had under the Vessel of our God, our Father himself. Yet, Omolon hadn't contained the work of our Father to just a riverbank; rather, this fortress of God stretched across the Russian nation, for all to hear and rejoice!\n\nHowever, the marauder, the despot, and the cultist gave not cries of glory and salvation; rather, they cried with a burning hate, as they prepared their arms and ammunitions for the days to come, and the deciding fate of the land of God's chosen, having come so far from the depths of the tundra to bring forth the light of the LORD. Nevermore was this to be a land of destruction wrought by the wrathful and the persecutor, for this was to be God's Kingdom on Earth, and it is under the banner of Our Father that we shall guide ourselves towards such redemption for all who would bear the name Russian. The peaceful, loving, tranquil nature of our LORD was never to be dismissed through all we had done; however, the men of our world do not understand such notions taught throughout the scriptures, and thus necessitated the just hand of a more Old Testament, bringing forth the justice and fear of our God through the fields of war, so that we may triumph over the conquests of Gehenna in this battered world.\n\nThe burning fields gave no images of power and glory to the mind of our Father, however. As he continued to stare, he knew this was no way for mankind to act to one another, to tear each other apart without retraction. One day, this world would see the last of its war and embrace one another in the workings of our LORD's love. And on that day, our Father swore, he would rest."
